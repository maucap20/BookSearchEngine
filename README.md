Description

The Book Search Engine is a web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API and save their favorite books to a personal account. This project leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and has been refactored to use GraphQL with Apollo Server, replacing the original RESTful API. The application provides a seamless user experience for avid readers to manage their reading lists, whether they are logged in or browsing anonymously.
